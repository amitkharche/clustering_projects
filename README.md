# 🤖 Clustering Projects Repository

This repository contains a suite of end-to-end **unsupervised learning (clustering)** solutions across multiple domains — traffic analysis, customer segmentation, news classification, and retail product clustering. Each project includes a training pipeline, a deployable Streamlit app, and modular structure for easy reuse.
